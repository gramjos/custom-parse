    <p>Broadly speaking, threading allows for different parts of a program to run concurrently.  A thread is a separate flow of execution, meaning two things will happen at "<em>*once</em><em>" (not really for most python implementations) they merely appear to happen at once. Getting python to run multiple tasks simultaneously requires a non-standard implementation or using the multi-processing library. The mainstream CPython implementation causes threads to be ineffective is some situations dues to [[Python's GIL]] that </em>essentially* limits only one thread to run at once.</p><h4>What is a good candidate for threads?</h4><p>Tasks that spend time waiting for external resources</p><h4>What is <em>*NOT</em>* a good candidate for threads?</h4><p>CPU-bound problems. Then use the multi-processing library.</p><pre><code class="language-python">import logging

def thread_function(name):
    logging.info("Thread %s: starting", name)

If a program is running threads that are not daemons then the program will wait for those to finish before terminating the program.</p><p>--- [Source - Real Python](https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/)</p>

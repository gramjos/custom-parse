    <p>> [!info]- What is a GIS > High Level: A Geographic Information System is a set of computer tools that allows one to work with data that is tied a particular location on Earth. > A database with attributes that have a spatial Object tied to each record.  > A GIS includes the tools for creating data, map making and analyzing the relationships</p><p>> [!info]- What can a GIS be used to do? > land use planning, environmental management, sociological analysis, business marketing, city planning.  > "Bartlett Map hub" examples: "Railroad Crossing Complaint Logger" ArcGIS Online map and form.</p><p>> [!info]- What are the types of map data?  > <em>*Discrete and Continuous</em>* > Discrete - finite or countably infinite set of values. Can be categorical or numeric. Example: Student in a class (cant have a half student) and outcomes of rolling a dice, or Land cover options. > Continuous - Can take any value within a range (real numbers). Examples: Temperature, height and weight</p><p>> [!info]- What are Data Formats? > <em>*Raster and Vector</em>* > Raster - used a bit map data structure (cells in a grid approach to defining space). Ideal for continuous change across a region like land cove classification  > Vector - uses XY referenced vertices and paths for discrete data ideal for governmental boundaries > TIN - Triangular Irregular Network, defines a set of adjacent triangles over a space. > Raster V. Vector: > - Vector provides more compact storage for discrete objects like for boundaries. Vector data models only store the perimeter of the entity while raster would have to store the area.</p><p>> [!info]- What is map scale > Is the conversion of from a map distance to reality</p><p>> [!info]- What is Resolution > refers to the sampling interval at which data is acquired.  > <em>spatial resolution</em> - the distance interval at which the measurement was taken > <em>temporal resolution</em> - time interval</p><p>> [!info]- What is precision > number of significant figures</p><p>> [!info]- What are shapefile > developed by ESRI > vector format > consists of many files:  > .dbf for stores attributes >  .sbn for > .shx stores spatial extent  > .shp stores location geometry  >  .shp.xml for meta data  >  .prj stores coordinate system</p><p>> [!info]- What are geodatabases > types: personal, file and enterprise. Distinguished by storage. Respectively, MS Access file, folder in file system, commercial Relational Database Management System.</p><p>> [!info]- What is Geographic Coordinate System? > Angular measurement from the center of the Earth</p><p>> [!info]- What is Map Projection > transformation of a 3D earth model to 2D map. > Three major classes: Cylindrical (UTM), Conic (Lambert), Azimuthal (polar)</p><p>> [!info]- Geo-Reference V. Geocode > geocode - given name of location coordinates are returned > geo-reference - aligns different geo information to a known GCS (through: data shifting, scaling, rotating, rectifying)</p><p>> [!info]- Spatial Join > combining tables based on spatial features by containment or proximity criterion</p><p>> [!info]- Overlay  > viewing two feature classes at once</p><p>> [!info]- Buffer > creates new zone around the proximity of a feature</p><p>> [!info]- Buffer > creates new zone around the proximity of a feature</p>
